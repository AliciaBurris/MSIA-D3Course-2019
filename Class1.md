# Welcome to Day One! :D

# Agenda:

Here's what we'll learn about today!

- Introductions to learn about each other
- What is D3?
- Technical Setup
- axes and scales
- Data joins
- Our First Scatter plot!

## Introductions
1. First, write down on a notecard 1) some goals you have for yourself in this class, and 2) you experience level with javascript / css / html.
2. 30-second introductions: name, background, goal for the class, favorite thing to do that does not involve computers.

Expectations about communicating with me: I may not be available outside of class. If there are subjects you'd like me to spend more time on next class, feel free to tell me after class or email me and let me know.  

## Talk: [Intro to D3](https://github.com/molliemarie/SharedSlides/blob/master/whatIsD3.pdf)

What is D3.js? When should we use it? When shouldn't we?

Also, we'll check out some [cool D3 examples](d3examples.md) to get us excited!

## [Technical Setup](TechnicalSetup/README.md)
To make sure our computers are all set up for what's to come.

## Exercise: [Make the "scatter plot" in three different ways!](Projects&Exercises/scatter3ways.md)

In these exercises you will be making the same scatter plot in three different ways: 

- Using [HTML, CSS, and SVG](Projects&Exercises/Scatter3Ways/scatterHtml.md)
- Using [D3.js](Projects&Exercises/Scatter3Ways/scatterD3.md)
- Using [D3 AND data joins](Projects&Exercises/Scatter3Ways/scatterD3DataJoin.md)

## D3.js is not intended for **only** data visualization

D3 is not intended just for data visualization; like jQuery, it's useful for DOM selection and manipulation, or simply for creating structured HTML pages. It's also public-facing on more web sites than you think. In [this activity](Projects&Exercises/ExploreSite.md), we will explore some of its features.

## Exercise: [Building our first scatter plot](Projects&Exercises/anscombeQuartet/anscombe_part1.md)

We'll now build our first full chart by plotting one of the Ambscombe data sets in a scatter plot.

## Exercise: [Uploading our projects to Bl.ocks](TechnicalSetup/blocks.md)

Bl.ocks is the main site where D3 projects are posted. Let's check it out and learn how to post our own Bl.ocks!

## Exercise: [Axes Practice](Projects&Exercises/AxisPractice/README.md)

This activity will help with your understanding of scales and axes.

## Exercise: [Adding interaction to our first scatter plot!](Projects&Exercises/anscombeQuartet/anscombe_part2.md)

Let's take the plot we made earlier and make it fancier! In this section, we'll learn how to load our data dynamically and add some interactions!

## Activity/Discussion: [Creating a D3 Blueprint](Projects&Exercises/blueprint/README.md)

Rendering elements on the web, regardless of chart type, will require following the same pattern. Because we'll find ourselves doing this over and over, let's consider the steps involved.

## Discussion: End of Day Q&A

How was the first day? What questions do you have so far?

Homework: 

  - TKTK - exercise for them to try - plotting barplot in both directions - like example from past class?
  - Read the readings and be ready to discuss
  - Each Day there will be opportunities for us to practice brainstorming, ideally with someone's actual data viz idea. Come ready with ideas.
  - Gather links for cool visualizations you would like to share with the class, by you or others.
