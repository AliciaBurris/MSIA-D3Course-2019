# Bl.ocks

[Bl.ocks](https://bl.ocks.org/) is a website where people post their D3 projects. We will interact with bl.ocks in a couple ways throughout this class.

  1) Bl.ocks is a great place to find examples of things you're trying to build! I might use bl.ocks as examples as we go. In general, though, if there's something you're wanting to try in the future that you've never built, you can sometimes find examples on bl.ocks that you can model after.

  2) I encourage you to post your projects on bl.ocks as we go! This makes your projects easily shareable so you can show off what you've accomplished!

## Instructions

If you already have a github account (which you should), then you already have the ability to post to bl.ocks!

  1) Go to https://gist.github.com/. Assuming you're logged into github, you should be automatically directed to the page to create a new gist. You can also try going directly to your personal page (in my case it would be https://gist.github.com/molliemarie) and click "New gist".
  2) Type in gist description. 
  3) Type in index.html and copy and paste the contents of the page you are trying to re-create (which is probably not called index.html). Be sure that links such as to d3.v3.js are given in absolute terms, e.g. to the official d3 site, and not to a file in your folder.
  4) Any files that you refer to in the main html file should also be added.
  5) Click "Create public gist".

You'll now be able to view your gist at `https://bl.ocks.org/{your-github-name}`. (In my case, https://bl.ocks.org/molliemarie.)
